      'Physical Graffiti is the sixth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. It was released as a double album on 24 February 1975 by the groups new record label, Swan Song Records. The band wrote and recorded eight new songs for the album in early 1974 at Headley Grange, a country house in Hampshire, which gave them ample time to improvise arrangements and experiment with recording. The songs range in style from hard rock to folk rock and progressive rock, and they create a cohesive whole that emphasizes the bands dynamic musical style. The album was then mixed over summer 1974 and planned for an end-of-year release, but Led Zeppelins manager, Peter Grant, decided to delay it until early 1975 to avoid competition from the bands own singles.',
